# TCP/IP Socket - Image Conversion
This repository contains the reference applications to be used in the Laboratory 3 activity in order to verify the correctness of you implementation and the compliance to the protocol.

## How to Run
The applications are provided in the form of JAR file. To run the server you could simply execute `java -jar ./server.jar`. Instead, the client application expects three different inputs, namely the input image type, the output image type, and the name of the image file: `java -jar ./client.jar JPG PNG test.jpg`. Remember that, in order to run, the file must be placed inside the image directory (placed at the same level of the jar file).
